The run_analysis.R script performs the data downloading and then carries out the steps required by the assignment as follows:

Downloads the data from the provided URL, as txt files
Loads the data, namely:

	subject_train
	x_train
	y_train
	subject_test
	x_test
	y_test

The data sets are combined, to have three columns (subject, activity (y), variables(x)) and then the training and testing data sets are merged

The merged data set is then condensed to only include the x-variables required, i.e. means and standard deviations

The activities as numbers are replaced with their names, and the columns for each variable are suitably described

The condensed data set is then melted down into one row per subject-activity, with the average value shown for each variable - this is the tidied data set

The final tidied data set has 180 rows, and is written to a text file
